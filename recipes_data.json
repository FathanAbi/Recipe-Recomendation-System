Carefully pour in the cold soda-pop. One can is just about the right amount with a little left over to sip as you are stirring. Stir carefully. There will be some foam on the top but it will disappear as the Jello sets up. Pour into a glass bowl for serving. Refrigerate for 4 hours to set up.\nYou can also use other flavors of Jello. Black cherry is a really nice one to make with the lime soda at the holidays.\nThis can also be made sugar-free if you are diabetic. Use diet soda-pop, sugar-free Jello and natural applesauce."

Add the flour, baking powder, cornmeal, sugar and salt to a mixing bowl. Add the heavy cream and stir until just combined.\nAt this point (before adding the dumplings), you can remove the chicken from the soup, let it cool slightly and remove the chicken from the bones. I did this, as it makes it much easier for kids to eat! Add the chicken back to the pot and return to a gentle simmer.\nDrop the dumpling batter into the simmering soup, by the heaping tablespoonful. Cover the pot and simmer for 12 minutes.\nLadle the chicken and dumplings into serving bowls and garnish with chopped fresh parsley.\n(Recipe adapted from Cookie Magazine: November 2007)"

Turn up the heat a bit.\nWhen sausage is looking about done, add tomato chopped to your liking. I chop it small.\nAdd the cleaned and rinsed escarole. Sometimes Escarole heads can be really big or pretty puny. Since 2 puny heads (~size of a larger grapefruit) = 1 really big head (~size of a football), opt for whatever combination you can get. To clean it, I just take off a bunch of leaves, rinse them under cold water, snap them in half, and throw them in the pot. Don't worry about water getting into the pot. Let the escarole cook all the way down to the point you see the lines at the base of the leaf. You'll see what I mean. Don't undercook it. You'll taste it and it's not a good taste. At this point I rely on the taste test to know when it's done.\nOnce escarole is sufficiently wilted, add your canellini beans. Of course, make sure they are sufficiently rinsed then drained. Heat them thoroughly.\nAdd chicken stock, more or less depending on how soupy you want it. The broth is so good that you may want to make it soupy, which I did the second time around!\nLet it simmer until the outer layer sheds off of the canellini beans. Serve with some warm crusty bread (I use the whole grain because it's SBD-friendly) and enjoy!"

Add one spoonful of hot caramel at a time to the yolks, and make sure to mix well before adding more. You are tempering the egg yolks by doing this - and making sure that you don't scramble them.\nWhen you have mixed all of the caramel into the yolks, the mixture will still be hot. Immediately pour the hot caramel over the chocolate. Let it sit for a moment, and then stir until all of the chocolate is melted and smooth.\nNow, if you are like me, and are a little lazy, and therefore didn't chop the chocolate very finely, instead dilly dallying, taking pictures, puttering about, etc. . . And if you didn't get the hot caramel poured over the too big pieces of chocolate in time- then it isn't going to melt all of the way.\nIn this case, place the bowl over a small pot of simmering water and watch it very carefully, stirring like crazy until smooth- then IMMEDIATLEY remove from heat.\nNow, just to be clear- the consistency is not like ganache- remember that there is caramel in there. It looks like chocolate caramel- thick and shiny.\nNow, whip the remaining two cups of cream to soft peaks.\nAdd about 1/4 cup of the whipped cream to the chocolate caramel and vigorously whisk until the chocolate caramel thins a bit and gets glossy. Next, fold in half of the whipped cream. Then add the next half of the whipped cream and fold until everything is smooth and uniform. And you are done!\nYou can either spoon or pipe the mousse into bowls or glasses. Chill until ready to serve.\nGarnish with fresh berries, edible flowers or chocolate shavings.\nEnjoy!"

Let the tomatoes sit in the strainer for at least 10 minutes, slightly squeezing the tomatoes with your hand every once in a while, coaxing the water out of the tomatoes. Allowing the tomatoes to drain this way will leave you with a more concentrated tomato flavor for your pasta salad.\nMeanwhile, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small container (or shake all the ingredients together in a Mason jar.) Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste.\nAfter the tomatoes have been sitting in the strainer for at least 10 minutes, place tomatoes in a large mixing bowl and discard any juice that came from the tomatoes. Add the finely chopped parsley and dressing to the bowl. Mix to combine. Add the pasta to the mixing bowl and toss again until all of the pasta is covered with the dressing and tomatoes.

This will take about 5 minutes, or more depending on the heat level. Once thickened, transfer the custard back to the heatproof bowl, place a piece of plastic wrap over the surface (so a skin doesn't form), and let cool fully in the fridge.\nWhile the custard cools, make the cake. Preheat the oven to 350F and grease and flour (or line with parchment) two 8\" round cake pans.\nIn a clean bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until stiff. Scatter half of the sugar over the egg whites and whisk to combine.\nWhisk in half of the almond flour (the mixture will deflate slightly at this point; that's fine).\nUsing a spatula, fold in the remaining sugar, almond flour, almond extract, and all-purpose flour. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.\nFinish the frosting by beating the softened butter until very light and fluffy. Slowly add the cooled custard with a pinch of salt and beat until spreadable. If it seems too soft, chill in the fridge for 20 minutes then try beating it again.\nTo assemble the cake, spread a layer of frosting over the first cake layer, top with the second cake layer, then frost the tops and sides."

        "fullRecipe": "Using a Japanese grater or a microplane zester, grate the ginger nub into a small bowl. Then cover it with about 2 tablespoons of hot water, set aside to steep.\nFor the dashi stock, rinse the kombu pieces under cold water to get rid of any extraneous salt. In a medium sized pot, rehydrate the kombu in 5 cups of cold water. Allow to sit for about 30 minutes.\nWhile the kombu is rehydrating, preheat your oven to 400\u00c2\u00b0F. Using a sharp knife, cut the skin off your squash and divide into 1 1/2 inch chunks. Do not cut too small or else they will not hold together well. Lay the squash on a large sheet pan, making sure not to overcrowd. Sprinkle with a few pinches of salt, freshly ground black pepper and grapeseed oil. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes, flipping halfway into the cooking time.\nAfter 30 minutes, set the pot with your kombu and water over high heat. Right before it reaches a boil, remove the kombu pieces. Add the katsuobushi and dried sardines. Bring to a boil, and turn off the heat immediately. Allow to steep for 15 minutes. With a fine mesh strainer, strain the liquid. Use a spoon to press out as much of the liquid as possible. Don't let any go to waste! Reserve the stock\nFor the meatballs, combine the pork, salt, white pepper, egg, and scallions into a medium sized mixing bowl. Put the tofu into a separate bowl and use a fork to gently mash the tofu so that only a few small chunky pieces are left over. Add the tofu and the ginger along with its water into your meat mixture. Mix using a large spoon until thoroughly mixed. Your mixture should be mixed to the point where the meat fibers are no longer separated and pronounced.\nSince we are making four poached eggs, we are going to make them ahead of time. Set a medium sized pot filled 3/4 of the way with water to boil. Now gently crack an egg into a small bowl. Using a large metal spoon, stir in one direction until you make a rapid whirlpool. Quickly but carefully slide the raw egg into the water. As the water continues to turn, most of the egg whites should stay together. Cook for 2-3 minutes for a runny yoke. Remove the egg using a slotted spoon and place in an ice water bath to stop the cooking. Do this for the other 3 eggs. Reheat the eggs in warm water before serving.\nUsing a medium pot, bring your dashi stock back up to a boil. Add the shiitakes and potatoes, cook for 5-8 minutes over medium-high heat. Then, add your roasted squash. To form the meatballs, take a large metal spoon and scoop up about a tablespoon worth of meat. Wet your left hand so that the meat doesn't stick. Using the metal spoon and a scooping motion, roll the meat into a ball. The meat should stick together easily. Don't overwork. Gently place into the soup. Once all the meatballs are in the pot, bring to a boil and then turn down the heat to medium high. Cook for about 8-10 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.\nWhile the meatballs are cooking, combine the two types of miso in a small bowl. Ladle some of the hot soup in. Use a spoon to work the miso into the liquid, making sure no clumps are left. Turn your stove off. At this point, I like to add about half of the miso liquid initially. Give it a taste. Add more of the miso little by little, until the flavor is perfect.\nServe immediately topped with a poached egg and scallions."

Turn to medium high heat and let heat until the surface shimmers. Test heat by dropping a pinch of the French fried onion mixture (or flour) into oil; if it begins to cook instantly, the oil is ready.\nPlace three plates or large bowls side-by-side near the pot of heated oil. Place chicken breasts on first plate, pour beaten eggs onto second plate, and place French fried onion mixture onto third plate. Dip chicken breast, one at a time, into egg, coating each side, then do the same in the French fried onion mixture. The amount of chicken to cook at a time depends on the size of your pot or fryer, but do not overcrowd. Cook for about 1 minute or until the coating on the chicken is dark brown. Continue until all chicken is fried. Place finished chicken breasts on a plate with a paper towel or two on it to absorb excess grease. Enjoy!"

Gradually add 1 3/4 cups flour, kneading gently into mixture in bowl until dough holds together and is almost smooth. If dough is very sticky, add more flour by tablespoonfuls. Turn dough out onto floured surface; knead gently but briefly just until smooth. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces.\nLine 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Sprinkle parchment lightly with flour. Working with 1 dough piece at a time, roll dough out on floured surface to about 1/2-inch-thick rope. Cut rope crosswise into 3/4- inch pieces.

DO AHEAD:\nWorking in 2 batches, cook gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, 15 to 17 minutes (gnocchi will float to surface but may come to surface before being fully cooked). Using slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to same parchment-lined baking sheets. Cool. DO AHEAD:\nCook butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat just until golden, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.
