Carefully fit the dough into a deep 9 1/2 or 10-inch pie dish and trim the edges, leaving a 3/4-inch overhang.\n3. Fold under the edge of the dough and press along the rim of the pie pan to form a high, fluted border.\n4. Refrigerate the pie shell for at least 30 minutes.\n5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and position a rack in the center of the oven.\n6. Line the pastry with lightly buttered parchment paper or aluminum foil (buttered side down) and fill with pie weights or dried beans.\n7. Bake until the crust is just set, about 12 minutes.\n8. Remove the paper and weights and bake until the crust is just golden, 8 to 10 minutes.\n9. Remove from the oven and brush the pastry with the egg white.\n10. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\n11. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F.\n12. In a heavy saucepan combine the milk and cream and heat until mixture just comes to a simmer.\n13. Whisk the eggs, 3/4 cup of the sugar, salt, nutmeg, and vanilla together to combine.\n14. Add the hot milk mixture to the egg-sugar mixture and whisk to blend.\n15. Transfer custard mixture to the pie shell and bake until the custard is set but still slightly wobbly in the center, 40 to 45 minutes.\n16. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\n17. When cooled, transfer to the refrigerator to chill.\n18. While the pie is baking, make the blueberry topping.\n19. Combine the blueberries and cold water in a heavy, nonreactive saucepan.\n20. Bring to a boil.\n21. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and lemon zest.\n22. Stir the sugar-cornstarch mixture into the boiling blueberries and stir well to combine.\n23. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes.\n24. Remove from the heat and transfer to a small bowl.\n25. Place a piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap directly onto the surface and chill, stirring occasionally, until completely cooled, about 2 hours.\n26. When both the pie and the blueberry topping have cooled, top the pie with the blueberry topping.\n27. Serve immediately or continue to refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 day.\n28. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or ice cream on top, if desired.\n29. Note: If pie is refrigerated for more than 1 or 2 hours, allow to sit at room temperature a few minutes before serving.\n30. 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons bleached all-purpose flour\n31. 1 tablespoon sugar\n32. 1/2 teaspoon salt\n33. 6 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and chilled\n34. 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening\n35. 5 tablespoons ice water, or as needed\n36. Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a large bowl.\n37. Add the butter and shortening.\n38. Rub the fats between your fingertips and thumbs, or use a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n39. One tablespoon at a time, work in enough ice water just until the dough comes together, being careful not to over mix.\n40. Shape into a smooth ball of dough, flatten into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap.\n41. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to two days.\n42. Yield: Dough for 1 single-crust pie",

Combine Pickapeppa sauce, butter, honey, Tabasco, and pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over low heat until it is well incorporated.\n4. Let wings come to room temperature.\n5. Prepare grill for medium high direct heat. Grill dry rubbed wings for 20-25 mins, constantly turning the wings with tongs to maintain good grill marks without over-charing the wings. Take the biggest wing after 20 mins and take a bite out of it, and if the juices run clear, they are done. Place wings in a large bowl and toss with the jerk sauce.\n6. Serve with blue cheese dressing and carrots.\n7. I've made these wings for numerous Celtics, Patriots, Redsox, and Bruins games. There a tad on the spicy side, but still very good. If you don't have a grill, fry the wings at 375 in peanut oil or corn oil (don't use vegetable, your house will smell like fish). I hope you enjoy them with friends and family on your next game day!",

Stir in the chicken broth and return the chicken to the pot. Bring the soup up to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes.\n3. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Add the flour, baking powder, cornmeal, sugar and salt to a mixing bowl. Add the heavy cream and stir until just combined.\n4. At this point (before adding the dumplings), you can remove the chicken from the soup, let it cool slightly and remove the chicken from the bones. I did this, as it makes it much easier for kids to eat! Add the chicken back to the pot and return to a gentle simmer.\n5. Drop the dumpling batter into the simmering soup, by the heaping tablespoonful. Cover the pot and simmer for 12 minutes.\n6.

Tap the molds from Step 5 against your kitchen counter to rid of trapped air bubbles and smooth out the tops.\n9. When the oven has finished preheating, pop the molds from step 7 into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes.\n10. Once they have cooled, remove from the mold.\n11. If you don't have a mini gateau mold, you can bake the batter in a pound cake or normal cake mold and then cut it into bite sized pieces.",

If using the leaves, place 2 prawns on each leaf and, depending on the size of the leaf, either fold it over the prawns, securing it with a toothpick, or place another leaf on top of the prawns, again securing one leaf to the other with toothpicks.\n6. Place the packages on a grill over the fire and roast them for 2 minutes or less to the side, depending on their size.\n7. If you are not using leaves, simply skewer the prawns, 2 or 3 to the stem, and roast them for a minute or so on each side, letting their edges char.\n8. In this case, immediately position the prawns, skewers and all, on a warmed, deep platter over which the warm, perfumed oil has been poured, presenting them at once.\n9. If youve used the leaves, pile the roasted bundles onto a warm platter, passing them about, either already having set a small pitcher of the perfumed oil at each place or sending a larger one round the table.\n10. In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil nearly to a boil, remove it from the flame and add the remaining ingredients.\n11. Cover the pan and permit the mixture to steep for 1/2 hour.\n12. Gently reheat the perfumed oil over the fire while roasting the prawns.\n13. It should be very warm.",

Also, by \"good-sized\" I mean a pot that will contain all of the escarole leaves).\n2. Add sausage and cook thoroughly, but not overly. Turn up the heat a bit.\n3. When sausage is looking about done, add tomato chopped to your liking. I chop it small.\n4. Add the cleaned and rinsed escarole. Sometimes Escarole heads can be really big or pretty puny. Since 2 puny heads (~size of a larger grapefruit) = 1 really big head (~size of a football), opt for whatever combination you can get. To clean it, I just take off a bunch of leaves, rinse them under cold water, snap them in half, and throw them in the pot. Don't worry about water getting into the pot. Let the escarole cook all the way down to the point you see the lines at the base of the leaf. You'll see what I mean. Don't undercook it. You'll taste it and it's not a good taste. At this point I rely on the taste test to know when it's done.\n5. Once escarole is sufficiently wilted, add your canellini beans. Of course, make sure they are sufficiently rinsed then drained. Heat them thoroughly.\n6. Add chicken stock, more or less depending on how soupy you want it. The broth is so good that you may want to make it soupy, which I did the second time around!\n7. Let it simmer until the outer layer sheds off of the canellini beans. Serve with some warm crusty bread (I use the whole grain because it's SBD-friendly) and enjoy!",

The idea is to make the dressing thin enough to evenly coat all of the veggies& pasta lightly.\n5. Mix thinned dressing with the veggie& pasta mixture and toss to coat well.\n6. Chill at least 2 hours or overnight to allow pasta to absorb the dressing a bit- the chilled salad will appear dry.\n7. Taste for seasonings- you may add a little salt& pepper if desired, but it may not be necessary depending upon the dressing brand you selected.\n8. Toss salad again before serving.\n9. Garnish if desired.\n10.

In a food processor, combine 1/2 cup of the prepared cream mixture with the chipotle chiles and puree until smooth.\n6. Reserve the rest of the cream mixture for another use.\n7. Set aside.\n8. Turn a grill to high and close the lid.\n9. After 15 minutes, lower the heat to medium-high.\n10. Place the corn on the grill rack and grill for 5 minutes.\n11. Turn the corn over and grill for another 5 minutes.\n12. Remove the corn from the grill and set aside to rest for 5 more minutes.\n13. In the meantime, keep your grill on with the lid closed.\n14. Take the grilled ears of corn and pull back the husks, exposing the kernels but keeping the husks attached at the bottom.\n15. Increase the grill temperature to high and place a sheet of aluminum foil on one side of the grill.\n16. Place the pulled-back husks over the foil, allowing the exposed kernels to sit on the grill grates.\n17. (This is done so the husks don't burn before the corn can char.)\n18. Close the grill lid and allow the kernels to char so become dark and golden brown, about 5 minutes.\n19. Then turn the corn and char the other side.\n20. Remove the corn from the grill.\n21. Serve immediately alongside the chipotle crema, crumbled cheese and lime.",

While waiting for the sugar to melt, heat 1 cup of cream in a small saucepan until simmering.\n5. When the sugar is melted, or almost all melted, stir with a wooden spoon, and add the hot cream to the sugar.\n6. Keep the heat on low, and stir the caramel until all of the sugar is melted and the caramel is smooth.\n7. Now, with the bowl of whipped egg yolks, turn the mixer on medium. Add one spoonful of hot caramel at a time to the yolks, and make sure to mix well before adding more. You are tempering the egg yolks by doing this - and making sure that you don't scramble them.\n8. When you have mixed all of the caramel into the yolks, the mixture will still be hot. Immediately pour the hot caramel over the chocolate. Let it sit for a moment, and then stir until all of the chocolate is melted and smooth.\n9. Now, if you are like me, and are a little lazy, and therefore didn't chop the chocolate very finely, instead dilly dallying, taking pictures, puttering about, etc. . . And if you didn't get the hot caramel poured over the too big pieces of chocolate in time- then it isn't going to melt all of the way.\n10. In this case, place the bowl over a small pot of simmering water and watch it very carefully, stirring like crazy until smooth- then IMMEDIATLEY remove from heat.\n11. Now, just to be clear- the consistency is not like ganache- remember that there is caramel in there. It looks like chocolate caramel- thick and shiny.\n12. Now, whip the remaining two cups of cream to soft peaks.\n13. Add about 1/4 cup of the whipped cream to the chocolate caramel and vigorously whisk until the chocolate caramel thins a bit and gets glossy. Next, fold in half of the whipped cream. Then add the next half of the whipped cream and fold until everything is smooth and uniform. And you are done!\n14. You can either spoon or pipe the mousse into bowls or glasses.

Place the tomatoes in the mesh strainer and sprinkle with salt (about 1 teaspoon or so should do.) At this point, the salt is not just for seasoning but drawing the moisture out of the tomatoes. Let the tomatoes sit in the strainer for at least 10 minutes, slightly squeezing the tomatoes with your hand every once in a while, coaxing the water out of the tomatoes. Allowing the tomatoes to drain this way will leave you with a more concentrated tomato flavor for your pasta salad.\n4. Meanwhile, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small container (or shake all the ingredients together in a Mason jar.) Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste.\n5. After the tomatoes have been sitting in the strainer for at least 10 minutes, place tomatoes in a large mixing bowl and discard any juice that came from the tomatoes. Add the finely chopped parsley and dressing to the bowl. Mix to combine. Add the pasta to the mixing bowl and toss again until all of the pasta is covered with the dressing and tomatoes.

This will take about 5 minutes, or more depending on the heat level. Once thickened, transfer the custard back to the heatproof bowl, place a piece of plastic wrap over the surface (so a skin doesn't form), and let cool fully in the fridge.\n4. While the custard cools, make the cake. Preheat the oven to 350F and grease and flour (or line with parchment) two 8\" round cake pans.\n5. In a clean bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until stiff. Scatter half of the sugar over the egg whites and whisk to combine.\n6.

Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.\n8. Finish the frosting by beating the softened butter until very light and fluffy. Slowly add the cooled custard with a pinch of salt and beat until spreadable. If it seems too soft, chill in the fridge for 20 minutes then try beating it again.\n9.

For the dashi stock, rinse the kombu pieces under cold water to get rid of any extraneous salt. In a medium sized pot, rehydrate the kombu in 5 cups of cold water. Allow to sit for about 30 minutes.\n3. While the kombu is rehydrating, preheat your oven to 400\u00c2\u00b0F. Using a sharp knife, cut the skin off your squash and divide into 1 1/2 inch chunks. Do not cut too small or else they will not hold together well. Lay the squash on a large sheet pan, making sure not to overcrowd. Sprinkle with a few pinches of salt, freshly ground black pepper and grapeseed oil. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes, flipping halfway into the cooking time.\n4. After 30 minutes, set the pot with your kombu and water over high heat. Right before it reaches a boil, remove the kombu pieces. Add the katsuobushi and dried sardines. Bring to a boil, and turn off the heat immediately. Allow to steep for 15 minutes. With a fine mesh strainer, strain the liquid. Use a spoon to press out as much of the liquid as possible. Don't let any go to waste! Reserve the stock\n5. For the meatballs, combine the pork, salt, white pepper, egg, and scallions into a medium sized mixing bowl. Put the tofu into a separate bowl and use a fork to gently mash the tofu so that only a few small chunky pieces are left over. Add the tofu and the ginger along with its water into your meat mixture. Mix using a large spoon until thoroughly mixed. Your mixture should be mixed to the point where the meat fibers are no longer separated and pronounced.\n6. Since we are making four poached eggs, we are going to make them ahead of time. Set a medium sized pot filled 3/4 of the way with water to boil. Now gently crack an egg into a small bowl. Using a large metal spoon, stir in one direction until you make a rapid whirlpool. Quickly but carefully slide the raw egg into the water. As the water continues to turn, most of the egg whites should stay together. Cook for 2-3 minutes for a runny yoke. Remove the egg using a slotted spoon and place in an ice water bath to stop the cooking. Do this for the other 3 eggs. Reheat the eggs in warm water before serving.\n7. Using a medium pot, bring your dashi stock back up to a boil. Add the shiitakes and potatoes, cook for 5-8 minutes over medium-high heat. Then, add your roasted squash. To form the meatballs, take a large metal spoon and scoop up about a tablespoon worth of meat. Wet your left hand so that the meat doesn't stick. Using the metal spoon and a scooping motion, roll the meat into a ball. The meat should stick together easily. Don't overwork. Gently place into the soup. Once all the meatballs are in the pot, bring to a boil and then turn down the heat to medium high. Cook for about 8-10 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.\n8. While the meatballs are cooking, combine the two types of miso in a small bowl. Ladle some of the hot soup in. Use a spoon to work the miso into the liquid, making sure no clumps are left. Turn your stove off. At this point, I like to add about half of the miso liquid initially. Give it a taste. Add more of the miso little by little, until the flavor is perfect.\n9. Serve immediately topped with a poached egg and scallions.",

There are a variety of gluten-free pastas available. Most are made of corn, rice, quinoa, or buckwheat. Since these pastas lack wheat, which acts as a binder in traditional pasta, they cook differently and can get mushy quickly if overcooked. Reference the package when cooking each variety because cook times and procedures for the best results vary.\n7.

The moisture in them may make the mixture feel like a paste, but so long as it retains some texture it will work. Pour Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper into French fried onion mixture and stir to combine thoroughly.\n2. Fill a large pot, Dutch oven or deep fryer about halfway full with oil (I use Canola, which is healthier and doesn't affect flavor). Turn to medium high heat and let heat until the surface shimmers. Test heat by dropping a pinch of the French fried onion mixture (or flour) into oil; if it begins to cook instantly, the oil is ready.\n3. Place three plates or large bowls side-by-side near the pot of heated oil. Place chicken breasts on first plate, pour beaten eggs onto second plate, and place French fried onion mixture onto third plate. Dip chicken breast, one at a time, into egg, coating each side, then do the same in the French fried onion mixture. The amount of chicken to cook at a time depends on the size of your pot or fryer, but do not overcrowd. Cook for about 1 minute or until the coating on the chicken is dark brown. Continue until all chicken is fried. Place finished chicken breasts on a plate with a paper towel or two on it to absorb excess grease. Enjoy!",

Roast until squash is very tender when pierced with skewer and browned in spots, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool slightly. Scoop flesh from squash into processor; puree until smooth. Transfer to medium saucepan; stir constantly over medium heat until juices evaporate and puree thickens, about 5 minutes. Cool. Measure 1 cup (packed) squash puree (reserve remaining squash for another use).\n2. Meanwhile, cook potato in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. While potato is warm, press through potato ricer into medium bowl; cool completely. Measure 2 cups (loosely packed) riced potato (reserve remaining potato for another use).\n3. Mix squash, potato, 1/2 cup Parmesan, egg, nutmeg, and salt in large bowl. Gradually add 1 3/4 cups flour, kneading gently into mixture in bowl until dough holds together and is almost smooth. If dough is very sticky, add more flour by tablespoonfuls. Turn dough out onto floured surface; knead gently but briefly just until smooth. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces.\n4. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Sprinkle parchment lightly with flour. Working with 1 dough piece at a time, roll dough out on floured surface to about 1/2-inch-thick rope. Cut rope crosswise into 3/4- inch pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, roll gnocchi along back of fork tines dipped in flour, making ridges on 1 side. Transfer gnocchi to baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour. DO AHEAD:\n5. Working in 2 batches, cook gnocchi in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, 15 to 17 minutes (gnocchi will float to surface but may come to surface before being fully cooked). Using slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to same parchment-lined baking sheets. Cool. DO AHEAD:\n6. Cook butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat just until golden, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes. Add sage; stir 1 minute. Add gnocchi; cook until heated through and coated with butter, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan.
